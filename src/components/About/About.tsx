      Langton's ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very
      simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. It was invented by
      Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white
      cells. The universality of Langton's ant was proven in 2000. The idea has
      been generalized in several different ways, such as turmites which add
      more colors and more states.
